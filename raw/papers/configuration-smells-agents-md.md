which an external reference is cited appropriately. Notice that 6

purpose (cdp-use only provides shallow typed interfaces for the Number of commits
websocket calls). Consequently, the agent is able to understand
the role of the dependency without needing to load or inspect
the external repository directly.
## CDP-Use
We use a thin wrapper around CDP called cdp-use:
https://github.com/browser-use/cdp-use. cdp-use only
provides shallow typed interfaces for the websocket
calls, all CDP client and session management + other
CDP helpers still live in

However, after applying the proposed heuristic, we were
able to detect 16 instances of Blind Reference, i.e., references
cited in AGENTS.md files without appropriate context. After a
manual analysis, 14 cases were confirmed (87%). An example
is shown in Figure 9. As we can see, this configuration refer-
ences an external document (docs/plugin-reorg.md) to
explain the planned plugin system, but it does not provide any
contextual information about the document itself. Therefore,
the agent would need to load and inspect the referenced file
to understand the architecture and goals of the plugin system.

Fig. 10. Number of changes in AGENTS.md files (Init Fossilization corre-
sponds to files with a single commit)
However, it is possible that the 24 projects exhibiting Init
Fossilization were dormant projects, that is, projects with
limited activity and few commits. Therefore, the histogram in
Figure 11 shows the total number of commits made to these
projects after the creation of their respective AGENTS.md
files. As the histogram indicates, the hypothesis that these
projects were inactive was not supported. In fact, we did
not find a single project in such a situation, that is, with
zero commits after the creation of the AGENTS.md file. On
the contrary, we observed many projects with a substantial
number of commits, including two projects with more than
1,500 commits, for example.
F. Conflicting Instructions
The proposed heuristic detected 28 cases of Conflicting In-
structions. However, after a manual analysis conducted by the
first author, only 16 cases were confirmed (57%). This lower
precision is, to some extent, understandable, since identifying
contradictory instructions is indeed a more complex task.
Figure 12 shows an example of this smell. As can be observed,
the configuration specifies two directory paths for creating
